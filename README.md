# Effect-of-HSP90AB1-on-the-local-immune-response-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma

#### Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of bioinformatics methods to study the effect of HSP90β on the local immune response to liver cancer and its impact on the prognosis of liver cancer patients.

#### Instruction
1. The whole project is divided into two parts. 
2. The first part is to study the relationship between HSP90β and the local immune response of liver cancer in the TCGA database liver cancer data set and to study the effect of inhibiting HSP90β on the prognosis of liver cancer patients.
3. The second part is to verify the research in the TCGA database in the ICGC database. As a result, the research methods were similar.
4. Complete original project file for research using the TCGA database(链接：https://pan.baidu.com/s/1uPv8GF681NsE3YQTp5RBsw?pwd=1234 提取码：1234).
5. Complete original project file for research using the ICGC database(链接：https://pan.baidu.com/s/1UBYs6NAy1Y68ak8tTbxo5w?pwd=1234 提取码：1234).
6. Article analysis using R operations, data preparation using PERL operations.
7. This project only discloses all the original code used in the research. If you want to get the complete project content, you can download it through the link given.
