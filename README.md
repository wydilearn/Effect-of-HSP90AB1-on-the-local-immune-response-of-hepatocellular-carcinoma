# Effect-of-HSP90AB1-on-the-local-immune-response-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma
This project demonstrates the use of bioinformatics methods to study the effect of HSP90β on the local immune response to liver cancer and its impact on the prognosis of liver cancer patients
The whole project is divided into two parts. The first part is to study the relationship between HSP90β and the local immune response of liver cancer in the TCGA database liver cancer data set and to study the effect of inhibiting HSP90β on the prognosis of liver cancer patients; the second part is to verify the research in the TCGA database in the ICGC database. As a result, the research methods were similar.
